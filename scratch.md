# Scratch Activity

Welcome to our Scratch coding activity! Today, we will be working in small groups to create fun and creative sound clips using the Scratch platform. This activity will help you learn basic coding concepts while working together as a team. Let's get started!

## Group Activity

Create a 10-15 second sound clip

Decide on a theme for your sound clip. Some ideas include:

- TV show theme songs
- Nursery rhymes
- Commercial jingles
- Short musical pieces or sound effects

Remember to have fun and be creative! There are no limits to what you can create, so experiment with different sounds and sequences. Happy coding!
